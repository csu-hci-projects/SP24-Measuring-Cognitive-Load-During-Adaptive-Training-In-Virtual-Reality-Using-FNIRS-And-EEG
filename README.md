# SP24-Measuring-Cognitive-Load-During-Adaptive-Training-In-Virtual-Reality-Using-FNIRS-And-EEG

This is an extension GitHub repo for the ONR-XR multi-year project that my class project is extending on. The original virtual environment has been created by NUILab member, Lucas Plabst, linked here:

https://github.com/NuiLab/asTask.git

The virtual environment (most updated as of 02/XX/2024) is available in this repo called "XXX". My class project extends on this virtual environment slightly to allow for Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) to be integrated into the envrionment. LSL is cruical for both fNIRS and EEG measures to allow triggers to be sent and for measures to start recording as soon as Meta Quest 3 users begin their training. For simplicity, the code I created and added to the original environment is available in this repo called "XXX". Here is an additional README that explains in detail, the changes I made. 

In an attempt to increase description of the work I am doing in this project, additional details are available describing my work with Aurora, along with screenshots.
